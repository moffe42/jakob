# Public repository of JAKOB connectors #
A public repository of JAKOB conenctor can at present time be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/jakob/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FConnectors).

Each connector consistes of a connector code file and a configuration template file, both located in the same directory. To use the connectors copy the code file to `<JAKOB-DIR>/lib/WAYF/Connectors/`and the config template file to `<JAKOB-DIR>/config/connectors/`.

**NOTE that probably both the config file and the code file need to be modified before the connector can be used.**

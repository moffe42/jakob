#summary Describes the details about the JAKOB job configuration format

= Job configuration =

Configuration of a job in JAKOB is done with an PHP style array. The array is integer indexed. Each toplevel entry defines a call to a specific connector, with the define options. ONLY the first connector is called 
automatically. The subsequent connectors are only called if specified by a previously run connector. 

== Connector configuration ==
A connector configuration has the following options:

|| *Identifier* || *Type* || *Required* || *Description* ||
|| `data` || _array_ || Yes || Configuration data for the connector. See [ConfigurationFormat#data data] ||
|| `success` || _integer_ || No || Pointer to the next connector to be executed if the result of the connector is successful. See [ConfigurationFormat#success success]||
|| `fail` || _integer_ || No || Ppointer to the next connector to be executed if the result of the connector is unsuccessful. See [ConfigurationFormat#fail fail] ||

----

=== _data_ ===
Contains the configuration for the connector to be called

A connector configuration can contain the following options:

|| *Identifier* || *Type* || *Required* || *Description* ||
|| `_id` || _string_ || Yes || The id of the connector to be used. This must match the id that is configured for the conector. ||
|| `_priority` || _string(`'sync'`|`'async'`)_  || Yes || Indicates wether the connector should be called synchronous (sync) or asynchronous (async). If the connector is called async, that JAKOB will jump directly to the success connector without waiting for a response. The result of the connector is fetched either at the end or when a connector is called sync. If a connector is called sync, JAKOB will wait for the result. Depending on that result, JAKOB will either choose the success connector or the fail connector. *NOTE* only use sync if strictly necessary. Use of sync will halt the entire process until the connector has finished. ||
||`_options` || _array_ || No ||This array contains connector specific data, that will be parsed to the connector on invokation. ||
|| `_timeout`||_float_ || No || The maximum time a connector is allowed to run until the user is presented with the JAKOB UI. The values is a float in seconds where the decimal part is micro seconds.||
|| `_timeoutFatal`|| _boolean_ || No || If set, than all timeouts will be fatal. Meaning that if a timeout occurs, then the attributes gathered so far is returned with out waiting for the rest of the connectors to finish.||

----

=== _success_ ===
Contains a pointer to the next connector to be executed if the result of the current connector is successful. This must be the top level integer index in the configuration array. I no success/fail pointer is set then the job will terminate after the current connector has finished.

----

=== _fail_ ===
Contains a pointer to the next connector to be executed if the result of the current connector is unsuccessful. This must be the top level integer index in the configuration array. I no fail/success pointer is set then the job will terminate after the current connector has finished.

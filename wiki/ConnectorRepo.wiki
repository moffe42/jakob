= Public repository of JAKOB connectors =
A public repository of JAKOB conenctor can at present time be found [http://code.google.com/p/jakob/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FConnectors here]. 

Each connector consistes of a connector code file and a configuration template file, both located in the same directory. To use the connectors copy the code file to `<JAKOB-DIR>/lib/WAYF/Connectors/`and the config template file to `<JAKOB-DIR>/config/connectors/`. 

*NOTE that probably both the config file and the code file need to be modified before the connector can be used.*

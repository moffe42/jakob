Here you can see all the different user stories created for JAKOB. If you would like to create additional user stories, please read the "[How to create user stories](UserStories#How_to_create_user_stories.md)" section first.

The design of JAKOB are based on these low level user stories.

# User stories #

  * As a **User** I want to collect attributes from different sources so that I can pass on more attributes to a service.
  * As an **Administrator** I want to easily set up a new attribute collection so that I do not have to code.
  * As an **Administrator** I want to easily change the configuration of an attribute collection to accomodate for changes in an external data source.
  * As a **User** I want to have JAKOB collect attributes about me with out my interference so that they can be delivered to WAYF.
  * As an **Administrator** I want to have easy access to JAKOB so that I do not have to remember a password
  * As a **Developer** I want to have a clean interface for developing new connectors so that development is easy and fast.
  * As an **Attributestore** I want to bill a **Service** for releasing attributes.

# How to create user stories #

All user tories should be on the form:

> _As a **`[`user role`]`** I want to **`[`goal`]`** so that **`[`benefit`]`**_

Please set the user role in bold and capitalise it.

Keep the user stories as short as possible.

If you introduce a new user role please add it to the "[User roles](UserStories#User_roles.md)" section.
